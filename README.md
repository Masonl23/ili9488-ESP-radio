# ili9488-ESP-radio
In this project i am using a TSA2500 multipoint bluetooth audio amplifer with a parallel 16 bit esp32-s3 display to create a sleek looking interface.
This interface removes the need for physical hardware buttons and allows things such as 
volume control
mute/play
pair bt
setting transmitter/reciever mode 
to be all done with a touch of a lcd button. In addition to this the GUI will allow the user to view the current voltage of the battery as well as see the 
current current draw.
